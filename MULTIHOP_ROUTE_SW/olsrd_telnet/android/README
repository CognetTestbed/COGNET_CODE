Building olsrd for Android
--------------------------

In order to build olsrd and the plugins for Android, you will need to
download the free (as in beer, and mostly as in speech) Android NDK.  NDK r8b
or later is the best to have.  Almost everything can be built with NDK r6
or maybe earlier. The pud plugin requires NDK r8.

http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

Once you have that installed, run this in your terminal:

  make OS=android NDK_BASE=/path/to/your/android-ndk-r8b build_all

Then you can find olsrd in the root, and the plugin files in lib/*/*.so*

If using NDK older than r8, you will need to set the NDK_COMPILER_VERSION to
4.4.3 since the default compilter version, 4.6, was not included until NDK r8b.
Here's how:

  make OS=android NDK_BASE=/path/to/your/android-ndk-r7 \
       NDK_COMPILER_VERSION=4.4.3 build_all

Android App
-----------

As part of the Commotion project, there is an Android app being
developed to make it easy to install and run OLSR mesh networking on
Android devices.  This app is called Commotion Mesh Tether:
