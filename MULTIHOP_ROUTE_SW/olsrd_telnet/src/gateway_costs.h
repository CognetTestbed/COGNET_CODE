 * Weighing of the path costs:
 *
 * exitUm = the gateway exit link uplink   bandwidth, in Mbps
 * exitDm = the gateway exit link downlink bandwidth, in Mbps
 * WexitU = the gateway exit link uplink   bandwidth weight   (configured)
 * WexitD = the gateway exit link downlink bandwidth weight   (configured)
 * Wetx   = the ETX path cost weight                          (configured)
 * Detx   = the ETX path cost divider                         (configured)
 *
 *                     WexitU   WexitD   Wetx
 * path_cost_weight =  ------ + ------ + ---- * path_cost
 *                     exitUm   exitDm   Detx
 *
 * Since the gateway exit link bandwidths are in Kbps, the following formula
 * is used to convert them to the desired Mbps:
 *
 *       bwK
 * bwM = ----       bwK = bandwidth in Kbps
 *       1000       bwM = bandwidth in Mbps
 *
 * exitUk = the gateway exit link uplink   bandwidth, in Kbps
 * exitDk = the gateway exit link downlink bandwidth, in Kbps
 *
 *                     1000 * WexitU   1000 * WexitD   Wetx
 * path_cost_weight =  ------------- + ------------- + ---- * path_cost
 *                         exitUk          exitDk      Detx
 *
 *
 * Analysis of the required bit width of the result:
 *
 * exitUk    = [1,   320,000,000] = 29 bits
 * exitDk    = [1,   320,000,000] = 29 bits
 * WexitU    = [1,           255] =  8 bits
 * WexitD    = [1,           255] =  8 bits
 * Wetx      = [1,           255] =  8 bits
 * Detx      = [1,           255] =  8 bits
 * path_cost = [1, 4,294,967,295] = 32 bits
 *
 *                         1000 * 255   1000 * 255   255
 * path_cost_weight(max) = ---------- + ---------- + --- * 4,294,967,295
 *                              1             1       1
 *
 * path_cost_weight(max) = 0x3E418    + 0x3E418    + 0xFEFFFFFF01
 * path_cost_weight(max) = 0xFF0007C731
 *
 * Because we can multiply 0xFF0007C731 by 2^24 without overflowing a
 * 64 bits number, we do this to increase accuracy.
